## Configuration

Lem loads `~/.lem/init.lisp` when starting up.

You probably want to start it with

    (in-package :lem-user)

Otherwise, be sure to refer to Lem functions with the `lem:` prefix.

## Binding keys

Use the `define-key` function:

~~~lisp
(lem:define-key lem:*global-keymap*
    "C-x F" 'lem-core/commands/file:find-file-recursively)
~~~

Its first argument is a *keymap*. Essentially, there is a keymap for
global keybindings, for each programming language mode (such as
`lem-python-mode::*python-mode-keymap*`, you can find it in Lem with
the autocompletion), and for every other tool: there is a keymap for
`grep` mode, for the directory mode, for the different vi mode states,
etc.

You can also use `lem:define-keys` to define more than one key at once:

~~~lisp
(define-keys *global-keymap*
  ("C-a b" 'describe-bindings)
  ("C-a k" 'describe-key)
  ("C-a a" 'lem-lisp-mode:lisp-apropos)
  ("C-a c" 'apropos-command)
  ("C-a p" 'lem-lisp-mode:lisp-apropos-package)
  ("C-a f" 'lem-lisp-mode:lisp-describe-symbol))
~~~


## Writing one's own commands

Use `define-command`:

```lisp
(in-package :lem)
(define-command open-init-file () ()
    ;; @sasanidas
    (lem:find-file
        (merge-pathnames "init.lisp" (lem-home))))
```

or copy-paste this with `M-:`

```lisp
(lem:define-command open-init-file () ()
    (lem:find-file
        (merge-pathnames "init.lisp" (lem:lem-home))))
```

You can now call it with `M-x open-init-file`.

## Formatting

Formatters can be defined for major modes,
they are implemented as a function that accepts a buffer as an argument.

Some are built-in, but you can make your own in two ways:

1. `register-formatter`

You can register a formatter for an existing major mode like this:

```lisp
(lem:register-formatter my-mode #'my-formatter)
```

2. `define-major-mode`

If you are creating your own major mode,
you can add a formatter in the mode definition:

```lisp
(define-major-mode my-mode ()
    (:name "My mode"
     :keymap *my-mode-keymap*
     :formatter #'my-formatter)
  )
```

To use formatting, you can either manually invoke
`M-x format-current-buffer`, or enable auto-formatting
with `(setf lem:*auto-format* t)`

## Configuration

Lem loads `~/.lem/init.lisp` when starting up.

You probably want to start it with

    (in-package :lem-user)

## Writing one's own commands

Use `define-command`:

```lisp
(in-package :lem)
(define-command open-init-file () ()
    ;; @sasanidas
    (lem:find-file
        (merge-pathnames "init.lisp" (lem-home))))
```

or copy-paste this with `M-:`

```lisp
(lem:define-command open-init-file () ()
    (lem:find-file
        (merge-pathnames "init.lisp" (lem:lem-home))))
```

You can now call it with `M-x open-init-file`.

## Example users' init files

For inspiration, see:

- [@sasanidas](https://gitlab.com/sasanidas/lem-config/-/blob/master/init.lisp)
- [@sakurawald](https://github.com/sakurawald/.dotfiles/blob/master/lem/.lem/init.lisp)  Heavily rely on the `vi-mode`.

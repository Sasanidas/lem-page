NEW as of January, 2025.

[Coalton](https://coalton-lang.github.io/) is

> an efficient, statically typed functional programming language that supercharges Common Lisp.

Lem's Coalton mode provides:

- code highlighting for `.coal` files.
- indentation support.
- show autodoc for Coalton functions.
-  its arguments can be different from definitions since the information is from Swank, just like Common Lisp.
- compilation commands: `coalton-compile-defun` (on the usual `C-c C-c`) and `M-x coalton-compile-region`
